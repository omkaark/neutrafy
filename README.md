# Neutrafy ðŸ§ 

One-click freedom from emotionally charged news headlines using Chrome's built-in AI.

## The Problem

We're facing a crisis in how we consume news:

- 8 out of 10 people primarily get their news through headlines
- Publishers optimize for clicks using emotionally charged language
- Different word choices in headlines, even with the same information, significantly impact mental health
- This feeds into increasing societal division

## The Solution

Neutrafy transforms news headlines into their neutral form using Chrome's built-in AI, helping you:

- See news without emotional manipulation
- Make your own decisions about what's important
- Reduce mental fatigue from news consumption
- Break free from outrage cycles

2. Visit CNBC.com (more news sites supported soon)
